## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm JesÃºs Almansa

I'm an Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineer graduated from the Polytechnic University of Valencia, and I hold a Master's in Artificial Intelligence from the International University of La Rioja. Currently, I work as an AI Engineer at HI Iberia, where I develop innovative solutions using machine learning and deep learning to tackle complex challenges, such as detecting anomalies in offshore wind platforms and land change detection with satellite image analysis.

I also have experience in developing virtual reality tools at Simumatik, where I contributed to the creation of virtual industrial commissioning environments. I had the opportunity to complete my final degree project with this company, which you can check out here [My Final Degree Project](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1444434&dswid=-8880).

Throughout my career, I've worked in cybersecurity, which has allowed me to effectively integrate data, AI, and security knowledge to optimize decision-making in increasingly complex digital environments.
